## TODO List

### Modifications
- Random noise annealing: Introduce random (probably Gaussian) additive noise to the weights/biases proportional to their norms.
- RemoveEdge operation: Removes an edge with Minimum Norm Criterion and Cascade Node deletion
- Pruning

### Hyper-parameter tuning
- Dropout
- Drop edge
- Different Depthrate and Growthrate on layers
- Get an optimal result (probably better than ResNet!
- Run on ImageNet
